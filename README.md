## ELECTRONIC VOTING SYSTEM
In this case I have chosen blockchain electronic voting system that will be used for election pursposes.Traditional electronic voting systems have shown weakness in terms of maintaining data integrity and they are vulnerable to different attacks which is by far not convinient comparing to blockchain implementation in such voting systems. Blockchain is the way of organizing database in such a way integrity and availability is highly maintained and this data structure has proven to be convinient to be implemented in such systems.

### PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM
The main purpose of the system is to attain the following:
#### ELIGIBILITY
  <sub>In this only legitmate voters will be able to participate in the election process</sub>
#### UNREUSABILITY
 <sub> Voters should not be able to participate in the process twice. You can participate once. </sub>
#### PRIVACY
 <sub> Only a voter knows about the voters choice</sub>
#### NO ONE CAN OBTAIN INTERMEDIATE VOTING RESULTS
  <sub> The results will only be know after the overall process completes  </sub> 
	
#### SCOPE OF THE SYSTEM	
The verification of the identity must be done by a well know and trusted organization like national identification system to verify the identity and eligibility of the participant. In this case the voting system is applied in national level so the national identification system should e the one in charge of checking the eligibility requirement for the participant.

#### INTERACTION OF THE SYSTEM WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
The system should be integrated with national identification and also for biometrics requirements there is a need for the system to be able to communicate with bimetrical devices.

#### PRODUCT FEATURES 
The system should be able to fetch data from national identification system and in this case it should check the Date of birth of the participate and the nationality
The product must be able to verify the biometrical verification of the voter
After the vote is cast ,the voter should not be able to access the system to participate again , it should be able to identify if that particular participant has already participated in voting process
After the overall process completes , the product should be able to verify and process the results

#### SECURITY REQUIREMENT.

 * Anonymit
 * Audability
 * Accuracy
 * Vote privacy
 * singularity
 * Integrity
 * Transparency

#### USER CHARACTERISTICS
 * Above 18 years old
